3. Using search

   Search option is used to search the incident log with time span.

   ## Limiting a search by time is a key to faster result and is a best pratice.##

   Commands that create statics and visualisation are called transforming commands.

   We can share the share job log with other user it will remian active for 7 days, and every 10 min we need to refresh the log search.

   We can dowload the report in csv,xml,json.

4. Exploring Events

   If we search the objects in filters by default the event will turn the list, filtered keyword would be highlighted and we can examine the logs with timespan.
